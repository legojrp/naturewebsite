This is for Riverside for their nature thing. 


#### Where things are located...
- All things website will be in the /src folder
- All things server will be in the /src/backend folder
- All things frontend will be in /src/frontend folder EXCEPT the index.php which will be the home page, which will be located at /src
- Make sure when you commit your code, you commit it to a branch and pull request to main, and once it is reviewed we can add it.
- Make sure if there is an issue, mark it as so so we can fix it quickly by going to issues tab
